                How good a hacker Anderson was is unclear. But from context our game stats assume that he’s really, really good. However his acumen is limited to the technical side of the job and perhaps the usual social engineering techniques. More generally he is, as the Oracle put it, “none too bright”.

                Aside from his technical skills he’s initially an everyman. Over the course of the movie he unearths more heroic resource, particularly when it comes to courage.

                Neo’s avatar in the Matrix quickly becomes as least as powerful as the avatar of a top human partisan – such as Morpheus. He then becomes able to fight hand-to-hand at least as well as Morpheus, but unlike him also routinely employs firearms.

                Later on, Neo starts accessing his abilities as the Chosen One, making his Matrix avatar operate on a super-heroic level.
